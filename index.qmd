I am a 5th year PhD student in the Statistics Department at the University of Michigan.
I research likelihood based methods for partially observed Markov process (POMP) models.
I primarily work on theory, methodology, and software related to these models. 
My application area has primarily been infectious disease outbreaks, but I am also interested in a variety of other topics and application areas. 

My thesis advisor is [Edward Ionides](https://ionides.github.io/).

## Software 

- [arima2](https://github.com/jeswheel/arima2): This library aids maximum likelihood estimation of parameters of ARIMA time series models. The package is currently on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arima2/index.html), and there is an associated pre-print paper on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01198).
- [panelPomp](https://jeswheel.github.io/panelPomp): This R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/panelPomp/index.html) is used for inference of [Panel POMP models](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2019.1604367). I am not the creator of this package, but I am one of the primary contributors and maintainers of this package.
