I aspire to be a researcher and educator who supports, promotes, and defends diversity in all its forms.
This aspiration is driven both by a desire to be equitable and inclusive of all people, and by the understanding that diversity is an effective driver of innovation.
Without diversity of thoughts, opinions, and backgrounds, higher education would be destined to fail its purpose of advancing scientific discovery.

The primary reason I have chosen to pursue a career in academia is my strong desire to positively influence society.
However, I am aware that my contributions in academia--whether through research, teaching, or service--will only have a truly beneficial impact if they are inclusive and considerate of all groups within our society.
As such, I am committed to fostering an inclusive and diverse environment in each of my teaching, mentoring, and research roles.

As an educator, I am committed to cultivating a classroom environment where all students---regardless of their background, race, gender identity, or abilities---feel safe, welcomed, and capable of learning.
I believe that fostering inclusivity begins with understanding each student on a personal level and being flexible in my teaching approach.
By recognizing the diverse strengths and backgrounds of my students and adapting my teaching methods accordingly, I can effectively deliver course material to benefit the greatest number of students.
Because it may be challenging to accommodate all learning styles simultaneously, I strive to provide supplementary learning materials that present course material from alternative perspectives than my own.
Moreover, I encourage students to take advantage of office hours for discussions in a non-judgmental setting.
Additionally, I acknowledge that traditional assessment methods may not be effective for everyone.
Therefore, I am open to exploring innovative approaches to evaluate student understanding and am committed to offering additional resources when necessary.

My approach to mentoring students, much like my approach to teaching, recognizes that each studentâ€™s needs and preferences are unique.
To develop a mutually beneficial mentor-mentee relationship, I prioritize getting to know students personally and adapting my mentoring approach to fit their individual needs.
During my time as a PhD student, I have had the opportunity to mentor undergraduate and master's students on their research projects.
Through this experience, I have learned the importance of listening carefully to the questions and concerns of those I mentor in order to address their specific needs.
Listening carefully to both verbal and nonverbal communication enables me to to create an inclusive mentoring environment where students from diverse backgrounds feel valued and supported.
% I strive to be approachable and sensitive to the unique challenges that students from underrepresented groups may face, and I actively seek out resources and strategies to support them.
By fostering open communication and showing a genuine interest in my mentees' personal and academic development, I aim to empower them to achieve their full potential.

I further intend to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in my research.
As previously stated, I am aware that diversity of thought and opinion are important drivers of scientific innovation, and therefore I am commited to seeking out collaborations that can provide perspectives that are distinct from my own.
As a researcher who works in an area with potential applications to public health, I recognize the importance of considering how my work may impact marginalized groups within our societies.
One of my particular application areas is the modeling of infectious diseases.
I believe that our efforts in this field can contribute to more equitable health solutions and policies, fostering a broader impact that extends beyond academia to positively affect diverse communities around the world.

% I am committed to using and building upon open-source tools to ensure that my research findings and methodologies are accessible to everyone, not just those with access to proprietary software.
% By making my work open-source, I aim to democratize research and empower a broader community of scientists, public health officials, and policymakers to engage with and benefit from my findings.

% Promoting diverse collaborations is another cornerstone of my approach to DEI in research. I actively seek out partnerships with researchers from various disciplines, institutions, and backgrounds. This not only enriches the research process with a multitude of perspectives but also helps in tackling complex public health issues in a more holistic and inclusive manner. I am particularly focused on collaborating with researchers and institutions in underrepresented and underserved communities to ensure that the benefits of my work extend to all segments of society.

% Throughout my life, I have benefited from various forms of privilege, and I have made a personal commitment to leveraging these to support and uplift those without the same privileges.
% I understand that I have the potential to use my education and life experiences to create meaningful, positive changes both within and outside of academia.
% Despite the privileges I have, I grew up in a small community that is underrepresented in academia.
% This experience has introduced me to some of the challenges faced by such communities and has driven my desire to represent and serve them effectively in my academic career.
% I seek to learn how to best represent and advocate for my community within the academic sphere and how to foster an inclusive environment that embraces diversity in all its forms.

I acknowledge that I do not fully understand all of the challenges that members of underrepresented groups face within and outside of academia.
Therefore, I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth in order to become a more effective ally and advocate for these communities.
As part of my commitment to fostering an inclusive and diverse academic environment, I am currently enrolled in the University of Michigan's Professional Development in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Certificate program, which I will complete by December 2024.
I am confident that this program will profoundly enhance my ability to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of my teaching, mentoring, and research.
By equipping myself with the necessary knowledge and skills, I aspire to make a lasting, positive impact on the academic community and beyond.
